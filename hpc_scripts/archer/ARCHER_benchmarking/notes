A first few commands for ARCHER:
qsub <submit_script>.sh
    -> submit a job
qstat -u <username>
    -> view submitted jobs
qsub -W depend=afterany:XXXXXXX <submit_script>.sh
    -> submit a job with dependency on a previous job (XXXXXXX is the job ID number, in number in the 1st col of the qstat  output)
    
Most info on usage is on the SAFE page
A good guide to all things archer is found at:
http://www.archer.ac.uk/documentation/getting-started/
or:

The submit benchmark_template.sh is a useful guide to what you might use as a submit script.
To use:
1. change simulation name (line 3)
2. select number of nodes (replace NNODES on line 4)
3. change walltime to 24 hours (replace 0:15:0 with 24:0:0 on line 5)
4. check project code (line 6)
5. complete command (replace NCORES by the number of nodes you have chosen, multiplied by 24, on line 12
                     and change anything after 'aprun -n NCORES mdrun_mpi')


This folder contains tools for running benchmarks quickly:
submit_benchmark_template.sh
    -> template file - you need to alter the line '#PBS -A e280-Sansom' to have your project code, and also the name of the tpr file.
make_benchmark
     -> run this script to generate a set of submit files (using the submit_benchmark_template.sh file) for different number of cores for benchmarking. You might want to alter the number of cores you test by changing the numbers in the line 'for n in 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256; do'.  Note that this script assumes that there are 24 nodes per core, which is correct for ARCHER but not necessarily other machines.
run_benchmark
    -> run this script to submit all of the submit files you have generated.  You will need to update the line '
for n in 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256; do', to be the same as whatever you decided to use in make_benchmark

The final file, read_log_files_ARCHER reads the log files created and outputs the number of ns/day (which is reported at the end of the log file) into an output file, benchmark results. 
Update the line that starts 'for nnode...' so that the numbers agree with what you went for in make_benchark and run_benchmark.
